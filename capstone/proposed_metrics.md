Proposed Metrics


PRODUCT
fct_order_items > count of orders by product - view overtime with timeframe flexiblity, total sales by product

MARKETING
fct_customers > count of orders, total spend, average spend, first order date, last order date, retention metrics (percent of customers who made 2nd order, Nth order)
note. a sales funnel would be a nice to have for a marketing team. But do not seem to have these data points available. 

fct_order (possibly simply fct_order_items) > order review metrics, average score by demographic/product/timeframe

FINANCE
fct_order_items > total gross revenue, total net revenue, revenue vs budget/forecast by select timeframe/granularity. 
                > total sales by seller, total SOP by seller

LOGISTICS
fct_order_items > total freight value, average freight value
transportation costs
